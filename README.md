# UAS4STEM logger v4

This is meant to serve as the replacement for the old UAS4STEM logger

The reason is that I want to do some number crunching that Node.js can't handle,
and therefore I am switching to C++ and GTK over the old Electron

As this is meant to upgrade the previous version, it is a full rewrite and therefore
a major version change
